## Project Overview
This project applies **logistic regression** in R to analyze health insurance policyholder data and predict the risk of **second heart attacks**. Using demographic and clinical features such as age, weight, cholesterol, stress, and anxiety, the model identifies high-risk patients and supports insurers in targeting interventions (e.g., stress or weight management programs).  

The goal is to extend patient lives, improve outcomes, and reduce costs for the insurance company. The work follows the **Data Analytics Life Cycle**, ensuring structured, high-quality results that align with organizational goals and enable more effective allocation of healthcare resources.

## Goals
- Identify **policyholders at high risk** for second heart attacks.  
- Provide **community education resources** to reduce risks.  
- Improve patient outcomes while **lowering costs and premiums**.  

---

## Methods
- **Data Source**: Medical claims database (age, marital status, gender, weight category, cholesterol, stress/anxiety).  
- **Technique**: Logistic Regression (RStudio).  
- **Evaluation**: Precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve.  
- **Future Improvements**: Incorporating lifestyle data (exercise, diet, family history).  

---

## Tools & Packages
- **RStudio** for analysis and visualization.  
- **Caret**: for model training and evaluation.  
- **Shiny**: to build potential stakeholder dashboards.

## Visualization Plan
Planned visuals include:  
- **Line charts**: tracking risk outcomes over time.  
- **Bar charts**: comparing categorical features (e.g., weight groups).  
- **Heatmaps**: correlations between variables.
