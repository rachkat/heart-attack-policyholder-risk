## Project Overview
This project applies **logistic regression** in R to analyze health insurance policyholder data and predict the risk of **second heart attacks**. Using demographic and clinical features such as age, weight, cholesterol, stress, and anxiety, the model identifies high-risk patients and supports insurers in targeting interventions (e.g., stress or weight management programs).  

The goal is to extend patient lives, improve outcomes, and reduce costs for the insurance company. The work follows the **Data Analytics Life Cycle**, ensuring structured, high-quality results that align with organizational goals and enable more effective allocation of healthcare resources.

## Goals
- Identify **policyholders at high risk** for second heart attacks.  
- Provide **community education resources** to reduce risks.  
- Improve patient outcomes while **lowering costs and premiums**.  

---

## Methods
- **Data Source**: Medical claims database (age, marital status, gender, weight category, cholesterol, stress/anxiety).  
- **Technique**: Logistic Regression (RStudio).  
- **Evaluation**: Precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve.  
- **Future Improvements**: Incorporating lifestyle data (exercise, diet, family history).  

---

## Tools & Packages
- **RStudio** for analysis and visualization.  
- **Caret**: for model training and evaluation.  
- **Shiny**: to build potential stakeholder dashboards.

## Visualization Plan
Planned visuals include:  
- **Line charts**: tracking risk outcomes over time.  
- **Bar charts**: comparing categorical features (e.g., weight groups).  
- **Heatmaps**: correlations between variables.

Predicting High-Risk Patients for a Second Heart Attack: A Data-Driven Initiative
Milestone One
Sonia, a health insurance program director, aims to identify which policyholders are at high risk of suffering from a second heart attack. The initiative leverages data mining to provide targeted community resources such as weight and stress management programs. Logistic regression will be used as the primary predictive tool, applied to the company’s medical claims database. Available variables include age, marital status, gender, weight-category, cholesterol, stress management, and trait anxiety. While these are valuable, gaps exist in lifestyle data such as diet, exercise, and family history. The analysis will evaluate whether the existing data is sufficient or if additional data collection is required to improve accuracy.
Milestone Two
Goals: The primary goal is to reduce second heart attacks by identifying high-risk patients and providing them with community education resources. This improves patient outcomes, lowers premiums, and reduces company costs.
Data Analytic Life Cycle:
• Problem Definition: Identify high-risk patients.
• Data Collection: Use claims data (demographics, medical factors, stress/anxiety levels).
• Preparation & Exploration: Clean data, manage outliers, analyze variable relationships.
• Model Development: Logistic regression for prediction.
• Evaluation: Measure precision, recall, F1-score.
• Deployment: Identify patients and connect them to resources.
• Monitoring: Continuously track and refine model performance.
Value: This life cycle ensures systematic development, validation, and refinement of the model, driving both health and financial benefits.
Milestone Three
Tool Applicability: R Studio is ideal for statistical modeling, data visualization, and handling
structured claims data.
Packages Recommended:
• Caret: Enables testing multiple algorithms, feature selection, and parameter optimization.
• Shiny: Allows creation of interactive dashboards for stakeholder engagement.
Milestone Four
Conclusion: The initiative provides three core benefits:
• Improved patient care: Targeted interventions extend lives and improve quality of life.
• Cost savings: Reduces expenses associated with repeated heart attacks.
• Business efficiency: Optimizes resource allocation to focus on high-risk patients.
Insights: Data-driven approaches replace generalized methods, allowing continuous improvement through the analytic life cycle.
Top 3 Main Points
• Goal: Predict and intervene with high-risk patients to reduce second heart attacks.
• Approach: Use logistic regression with claims data, refining through the analytic life cycle.
• Value: Improves patient outcomes, reduces company costs, and optimizes resource allocation.
Skills Demonstrated
• Data Mining & Predictive Modeling (logistic regression, feature selection).
• Data Preparation & Exploration (handling outliers, missing values, pattern recognition).
• Model Evaluation & Deployment (precision, recall, F1-score, iterative refinement).
• Strategic Thinking (linking analysis to organizational goals, cost savings, and patient outcomes).
Tools Recommended
• R & RStudio: Core environment for modeling and visualization.
• Caret: For predictive modeling, feature selection, and parameter tuning.
• Shiny: For interactive dashboards and stakeholder communication.
