## Project Overview
This project analyzes health insurance policyholder data to predict the risk of **second heart attacks**. Using **logistic regression** in R, the goal is to identify high-risk patients and propose targeted interventions (such as stress or weight management programs) that extend patient lives while reducing costs for the insurance company.  

The analysis follows the **Data Analytics Life Cycle**, ensuring structured, high-quality results that align with organizational goals.

## Goals
- Identify **policyholders at high risk** for second heart attacks.  
- Provide **community education resources** to reduce risks.  
- Improve patient outcomes while **lowering costs and premiums**.  

---

## Methods
- **Data Source**: Medical claims database (age, marital status, gender, weight category, cholesterol, stress/anxiety).  
- **Technique**: Logistic Regression (RStudio).  
- **Evaluation**: Precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve.  
- **Future Improvements**: Incorporating lifestyle data (exercise, diet, family history).  

---

## Tools & Packages
- **RStudio** for analysis and visualization.  
- **Caret**: for model training and evaluation.  
- **Shiny**: to build potential stakeholder dashboards.

## Visualization Plan
Planned visuals include:  
- **Line charts**: tracking risk outcomes over time.  
- **Bar charts**: comparing categorical features (e.g., weight groups).  
- **Heatmaps**: correlations between variables.
